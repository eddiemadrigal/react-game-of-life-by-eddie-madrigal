## Summary
The Game of Life was designed and developed by John Horton Conway in 1970. The game is usually referred to as "Life" and is designed to display cellular automation. There are zero players and the patterns shown on the screen are blocks on a grid that show the state of two contrasting colors: either green or grey.
